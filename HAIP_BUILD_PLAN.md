# HAIP — Build Plan

> Updated April 6, 2026 — Phase 7 complete. Competitive milestone reached.
> Name: HAIP (Hotel AI Platform). Separate repo from OTAIP.

---

## THE PRODUCT

An open-source, TypeScript/Node.js, API-first hotel PMS with native OTAIP agent orchestration and air booking. The only PMS in the world where AI agents are first-class citizens, not bolted-on afterthoughts. The Apaleo of open source — but with OTAIP agents built in and air distribution native.

**Open source repo:** Trojan horse for Telivity commercial layer (managed cloud, premium agents, enterprise support).

---

## ARCHITECTURE DECISION

**Option A — OTAIP agents ARE the PMS** (agents handle reservations, folios, housekeeping directly)
**Option B — PMS is a standalone system, OTAIP agents sit on top via APIs**

**Decision: Option B.** The PMS is a real PMS — it works without OTAIP. OTAIP agents connect via the same APIs any third party would use. This is how Apaleo's Agent Hub works. It keeps the PMS useful to people who don't want AI, and keeps the agent layer clean.

The PMS IS the product. OTAIP agents are the magic that makes it Telivity's.

**Confirmed by Dušan — April 5, 2026.**

## BUILD PHASES

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding & Data Model (Week 1-2)
**2 Claude Code sessions**

What gets built:
- Monorepo scaffolding (pnpm workspace, same structure as OTAIP)
- PostgreSQL schema: properties, rooms, room_types, reservations, guests, folios, charges, payments, rate_plans, rate_restrictions
- Multi-tenant schema design (property_id on every table, row-level security)
- NestJS app bootstrap with module structure
- OpenAPI/Swagger generation
- Docker-compose for local dev (Postgres + Redis + app)
- CLAUDE.md constitution (no invented domain logic rule)
- CI pipeline (lint, type-check, test)

**Deliverables:** Working NestJS app with database migrations, empty API endpoints, docker-compose, CI green.

**Estimate:** 2 sessions × 3-4 hours each = ~8 hours Claude Code time

---

### Phase 1 — Reservation Lifecycle (Week 2-4)
**3-4 Claude Code sessions**

What gets built:
- **Reservation module:** Create, read, update, cancel reservations
- **State machine:** Pending → Confirmed → Assigned → Checked In → Stayover → Due Out → Checked Out (+ No-Show, Cancelled)
- **Availability engine:** Room inventory by type per date, overbooking allowance
- **Guest profile module:** CRUD, preferences, stay history
- **Rate plan module:** BAR, derived, negotiated, package rates; MinLOS/MaxLOS/CTA/CTD restrictions
- **Room assignment:** Automated matching based on type, preferences, accessibility
- **Booking API:** Search availability → Select rate → Create reservation → Confirm
- Webhook events: reservation.created, reservation.confirmed, reservation.cancelled, reservation.modified

**Deliverables:** Working booking API. Can create a property, define rooms and rates, search availability, book, modify, cancel. All states work. Webhooks fire.

**Estimate:** 4 sessions × 3-4 hours = ~14 hours Claude Code time

---

### Phase 2 — Folio & Billing (Week 4-6)
**3 Claude Code sessions**

## TOTAL ESTIMATES

| Phase | Sessions | Hours | Weeks |
|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| 0. Scaffolding | 2 | ~8h | 1-2 |
| 1. Reservations | 4 | ~14h | 2-4 |
| 2. Billing | 3 | ~10h | 4-6 |
| 3. Front Desk | 2 | ~7h | 6-7 |
| 4. Housekeeping | 2 | ~7h | 7-8 |
| 5. Night Audit | 2 | ~7h | 8-9 |
| 6. Channel Manager | 3 | ~12h | 9-11 |
| 7. OTAIP Agents | 4 | ~16h | 11-13 |
| 8. Admin UI | 5 | ~20h | 13-16 |
| **Total** | **~27 sessions** | **~101 hours** | **~16 weeks** |

### What This Means in Real Time

- Claude Code sessions average 3-4 hours each
- At 1-2 sessions per day: **3-4 months** of consistent work
- At 1 session per day with breaks: **4-5 months** realistically
- Your time (domain input, reviews, direction): ~30 min/day average, heavier during Phase 1 and 7
- Biggest variable: Phase 6 (channel manager) depends on API access and partner relationships

### MVP Milestone (Phase 0-5): ~9 weeks

A standalone PMS that works for a single property. No OTA distribution yet, no AI agents, no UI — but the entire backend works. A hotel could operate on it via API.

### Competitive Milestone (Phase 0-7): ~13 weeks

PMS + channel manager + OTAIP agents. Now it's a real product. Hotels can get booked via OTAs, and AI agents can manage operations. This is where it gets interesting commercially.

## WHAT'S NOT IN THIS PLAN (FUTURE)

- Multi-property / portfolio management (Phase 9)
- Revenue management system integration (IDeaS/Duetto)
- Door lock integration (ASSA ABLOY, Salto)
- POS integration (MICROS, Toast)
- Accounting/ERP integration (QuickBooks, Xero)
- Guest mobile app / kiosk check-in
- Group bookings / allotments / attrition (meetings & events vertical)
- GDS distribution (Sabre/Amadeus hotel segments)
- Loyalty program engine
- Advanced reporting / BI dashboard

## DECISIONS LOCKED (April 5, 2026)

| Decision | Answer | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Agents in PMS or on PMS? | **On PMS via API** (Option B) | Dušan confirmed |
| Target market | **General — fork it, it's yours** | Dušan confirmed |
| MVP scope | **Multi-property** (STR operators need this) | Dušan confirmed |
| Repo | **Separate repo** from OTAIP | Recommended, Dušan confirmed |
| Name | **HAIP** (Hotel AI Platform) | Dušan confirmed |
| Domain questions | **Research agents found answers** | 12/12 answered |

## RESEARCH-INFORMED ADJUSTMENTS TO BUILD PLAN

Based on 12 domain questions answered by research agents:

1. **GDS architecture from day one** — GDS hotel bookings growing 13.5%/year, not declining. Design for it in Phase 0 schema even if integration comes in Phase 6.
2. **Compliance is a Phase 0-1 concern, not Phase 8** — PCI tokenization (Stripe), GDPR basics, guest registration forms, and tax engine are absolute MVP blockers. No hotel will adopt without them.
3. **Night audit automation is table-stakes** — 82% of hoteliers expect this. Already in Phase 5, confirmed as MVP priority.
4. **Basic housekeeping in MVP** — Small hotels need it built-in. Specialist tools (Optii, Quore) connect via webhook later.
5. **RMS integration is post-MVP** — 84% use RMS but it's not needed to operate. Architect data exports now, integrate later.
6. **Door locks are post-MVP** — 70% adoption expected but hotels operate fine without it. Phase 1 roadmap item.
7. **STR is a separate product line** — Research says fundamentally different needs (channel sync, dynamic pricing, automation). Build hotel PMS core first, STR module later. **Confirmed by Dušan April 5.**
8. **Revenue management + channel distribution is existential** — Dušan: "that's where they live or die." RMS data feeds and channel distribution should be elevated to Phase 1-2 priority, not Phase 6 afterthought.
8. **Apaleo Agent Hub is still experimental** — 4 agents, no scaling data. Don't make agents the core selling point. PMS must stand alone.
9. **Community building is a moat** — No dominant open-source hotel tech community exists. "Hotel Tech Builders" Discord + weekly calls could differentiate.

## ALL DECISIONS FINALIZED (April 5, 2026)

| Decision | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Agents | On PMS via API (Option B) |
| Target | General-purpose, fork it |
| MVP scope | Multi-property |
| Repo | Separate from OTAIP |
| Name | HAIP |
| STR vs Hotel | Hotel core first, STR module later |
| Channel distribution | ChannelAdapter interface — ship SiteMinder/DerbySoft adapters first (instant 450+ OTA reach), direct OTA adapters over time (Booking.com, Expedia). Same pattern as OTAIP ConnectAdapter. |
| Revenue mgmt + distribution | Existential priority — elevated to Phase 1-2 |
| Dušan's PMS experience | Limited to SiteMinder and STR tools. Treats hotel as "Air PSS/Distribution Lite" — domain decisions informed by air distribution parallels |
