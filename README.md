## What is HAIP

The hotel industry runs on closed-source, legacy PMS platforms that charge per-room fees, lock data behind proprietary APIs, and treat integrations as an afterthought. Hotels pay $5–15/room/month just for the privilege of managing their own operations.

HAIP is a **complete, production-grade hotel Property Management System** built from scratch with modern architecture. Reservation lifecycle, folio & billing, rate plans, housekeeping with digital checklists, night audit, channel distribution to 450+ OTAs, Stripe payment processing, Keycloak authentication, tax calculation engine, revenue management — and **9 built-in AI agents** that optimize revenue, predict cancellations, detect audit anomalies, schedule housekeeping, automate guest communications, and draft review responses. All open source under Apache 2.0.

What makes HAIP different is that **AI agents are built into the architecture from day one** — not as a bolt-on, but as first-class citizens with their own lifecycle, decision logging, and learning loop. HAIP is the sister project to [OTAIP](https://github.com/telivity-otaip/otaip) (Open Travel AI Platform). Together they form **Telivity's open-source travel infrastructure**. OTAIP agents connect to HAIP via the Connect API — the PMS works without AI, but the AI makes it extraordinary.

### What HAIP is NOT

HAIP is not a wrapper around another PMS. It's not a booking widget. It's not a SaaS dashboard with "AI" slapped on the marketing page. It's a real PMS with real hotel operations logic — night audits at 3am, folio routing rules, rate parity enforcement, guest registration compliance across jurisdictions.

**Option B Architecture** — The PMS is standalone. It works without OTAIP. OTAIP agents sit on top via the Connect API, using purpose-built endpoints for AI agent workflows. This is the [Apaleo](https://apaleo.com) model, done open source.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Multi-tenant from day one** — `property_id` on every table, designed for portfolio operators managing multiple hotels
- **Event-driven** — Webhook events on every state change (`reservation.created`, `folio.charge_posted`, `room.status_changed`). Build anything on top.
- **AI agents as first-class citizens** — 9 built-in agents with a common interface: `analyze() → recommend() → execute()`. Three operating modes: manual, suggest, autopilot. Decision logging for continuous learning.
- **ChannelAdapter pattern** — Same abstraction as OTAIP's ConnectAdapter. Booking.com direct adapter + SiteMinder adapter for 450+ OTA reach
- **Keycloak RBAC** — JWT authentication with role-based access control (admin, front_desk, housekeeping, revenue_manager). Guards on every endpoint.
- **Compliance as infrastructure** — PCI tokenization (Stripe), GDPR audit trails, jurisdiction-based tax calculation, guest registration per jurisdiction. Not bolted on — built in.
- **Real-time dashboard** — WebSocket broadcasting per property. Room status changes, new reservations, AI agent decisions — all pushed instantly.

---

## AI Agents

HAIP includes **9 built-in AI agents** — 4 for revenue management, 3 for operations intelligence, and 2 for guest engagement. Every agent follows the `HaipAgent` interface:

```
analyze() → recommend() → execute() → recordOutcome() → train()
```

### Operating Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Manual** | Agent analyzes and recommends. Human approves/rejects via dashboard. |
| **Suggest** | Agent recommends with confidence score. High-confidence decisions auto-execute. |
| **Autopilot** | Agent executes autonomously. All decisions logged for review. |

### Revenue Management Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Demand Forecasting** | Predicts future occupancy using weighted moving averages with day-of-week seasonality, booking pace, and last-minute demand signals. Heuristic model → statistical model progression. |
| **Dynamic Pricing** | Calculates optimal room rates based on demand tier, booking pace, lead-time decay, and weekend premiums. Enforces floor/ceiling rate constraints. |
| **Channel-Mix Optimization** | Ranks OTA channels by net revenue (gross × (1−commission) × (1−cancel_rate)). Recommends allocation shifts and stop-sell when occupancy exceeds thresholds. |
| **Overbooking Management** | Calculates optimal overbooking level using expected value optimization: (overbook revenue × fill probability) vs (walk cost × walk probability). Respects walk cost constraints. |

### Operations Intelligence Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Night Audit Anomaly Detection** | Scans checked-in reservations and folios for 10 anomaly types: unposted charges, missing tax, payment mismatches, stale check-ins, duplicate folios, unusual charges (z-score > 2.5 statistical outlier detection). Ranked by severity (critical/warning/info) and confidence. |
| **Housekeeping Optimization** | Builds workload-balanced cleaning schedules. Prioritizes VIP and early check-in rooms, groups by floor for route efficiency, estimates cleaning times by task type (checkout 30min, stayover 20min, deep clean 60min, suite 45min). |
| **Cancellation Prediction** | Scores every active reservation with a cancellation probability based on booking source (OTA 25% base vs direct 8%), deposit status, repeat guest history, VIP level, lead time, and days until arrival. Aggregates risk by date for overbooking decisions. |

### Guest Engagement Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Guest Communication** | Template-based lifecycle emails triggered by reservation events: confirmation, pre-arrival (3 days), day-of arrival, welcome (on check-in), post-stay, and win-back (90 days). Repeat vs first-time guest personalization. GDPR opt-out enforcement — unsubscribed guests get no marketing emails. Duplicate prevention via decision log. Configurable SMTP transport (defaults to draft-only). |
| **Review Response** | Drafts professional responses to guest reviews entered by staff. Keyword-based topic extraction across 10 categories (cleanliness, staff, value, noise, food, wifi, etc.). Sentiment classification from rating (1-2 negative, 3 mixed, 4-5 positive). Three response styles (formal/friendly/casual). Matches guests to reservations for stay-specific references. Template-based assembly — no LLM freeform text, no hallucination risk. |

### Decision Logging

Every agent decision is persisted:
- **Input snapshot** — what the agent saw when it made the decision
- **Recommendation** — what the agent suggested
- **Outcome** — what happened after (approved/rejected/auto-executed)
- **Performance metrics** — accuracy, revenue impact, approval rate

This creates a learning loop: each decision becomes training data for model improvement.

## OTAIP Integration — Connect API

The Connect API (`/api/v1/connect/`) is purpose-built for [OTAIP](https://github.com/telivity-otaip/otaip) AI agents. It provides higher-level abstractions over the core PMS endpoints, designed for agent workflows.

### Agent Endpoints

```
# Property Search (Agent 4.1 — Hotel Search)
POST   /api/v1/connect/search                      # Search properties by criteria
GET    /api/v1/connect/properties                  # List all properties
GET    /api/v1/connect/properties/:id              # Full property detail

# Booking (Agent 4.5 — Booking)
POST   /api/v1/connect/book                        # Book a room
GET    /api/v1/connect/bookings/:confirmationNumber/verify  # Verify booking
PATCH  /api/v1/connect/bookings/:confirmationNumber # Modify booking
DELETE /api/v1/connect/bookings/:confirmationNumber # Cancel booking

# Event Subscriptions
POST   /api/v1/connect/subscriptions               # Subscribe to events
GET    /api/v1/connect/subscriptions               # List subscriptions
DELETE /api/v1/connect/subscriptions/:id           # Unsubscribe
POST   /api/v1/connect/subscriptions/:id/test      # Test subscription
GET    /api/v1/connect/events                      # Poll for events

# AI Insights
GET    /api/v1/connect/insights/revenue            # Revenue optimization hints
GET    /api/v1/connect/insights/guest-triggers     # Guest communication triggers
GET    /api/v1/connect/insights/housekeeping       # Housekeeping optimization
```

### How OTAIP Connects

OTAIP's `packages/connect` will have a HAIP adapter (like `AmadeusAdapter`, `DuffelAdapter`). Lodging agents (Domain 4) connect to HAIP via this adapter. Both projects share TypeScript, pnpm, Vitest, and strict TS config.

```
OTAIP Agent → ConnectAdapter (HAIP) → Connect API → HAIP PMS → PostgreSQL
```

The PMS is the product. OTAIP agents are the intelligence on top.

## WebSocket — Real-time Events

HAIP uses Socket.IO for real-time event broadcasting to the dashboard and other connected clients.

### Connection

```typescript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

// Join a property room to receive its events
socket.emit('joinProperty', { propertyId: 'uuid-here' });

// Listen for events
socket.on('reservation.created', (data) => { /* ... */ });
socket.on('room.status_changed', (data) => { /* ... */ });
socket.on('housekeeping.task_completed', (data) => { /* ... */ });
socket.on('agent.decision_made', (data) => { /* ... */ });
```

### Broadcast Events

All webhook events are simultaneously broadcast via WebSocket to clients subscribed to the relevant property. Events follow the `entity.action` naming convention:

- `reservation.created`, `reservation.checked_in`, `reservation.checked_out`
- `room.status_changed`
- `housekeeping.task_assigned`, `housekeeping.task_completed`, `housekeeping.ai_assigned`
- `folio.charge_posted`
- `channel.sync_completed`
- `agent.decision_made`, `agent.cancellation_forecast_updated`
- `guest.communication_drafted`, `guest.communication_sent`, `guest.review_response_drafted`

## Compliance (Built In, Not Bolted On)

| Requirement | How HAIP Handles It |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **PCI DSS** | Never stores raw card data. Stripe tokenization via PaymentIntents. Payments table stores token + last four + brand. |
| **GDPR** | Audit trail on every data modification, consent tracking fields, data retention and deletion APIs. |
| **Guest Registration** | Configurable per jurisdiction. ID verification fields. EU police reporting interface planned. |
| **Tax Calculation** | Jurisdiction-based tax engine. Inclusive/exclusive handling. Sales, occupancy, tourism, and VAT tax types. Per-property rules with exemption support. |
| **Authentication** | Keycloak OIDC with JWT validation. Role-based access control on every endpoint. No credential storage in application. |

---

## Contributing

HAIP is built in public and contributions are welcome.

### The One Rule

**DO NOT INVENT HOTEL DOMAIN LOGIC.** All hotel domain knowledge must be researched and verified. Do not invent hotel operations logic. If unsure, open an issue. Don't guess — hotels are weirder than you think.

### How to contribute

1. Check the [open issues](https://github.com/telivity-otaip/haip/issues)
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` for code standards and conventions
3. Read the relevant KB section before writing business logic
4. Fork, branch, PR — tests required for all business logic
5. One module at a time. Don't boil the ocean.

### Development commands

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm build            # Build all workspace packages
pnpm dev              # Start API in dev mode (hot reload)
pnpm test             # Run all tests (551 tests, 45 files)
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript strict check
pnpm lint             # ESLint
```
